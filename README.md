This program was created to simplify the (bulk) downloading of comics from nhentai. Normally, if you wanna download a comic, you'll either need to login to 
an account or painstakingly go through every page and download it seperately. Tentacle solves this problem. It will crawl through the specified comics and download
each page to a seperate folder in the user-specified download directory.


## Features
- Download one or multiple comics by only inputting their "magic codes"
- Download comics in folders named after their "magic codes"
- Scrape the currently trending comics
